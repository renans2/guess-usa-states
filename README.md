* **Interactive list hovering**: Hovering a state in the list highlights the corresponding state on the map.
* **State flags display**: Each guessed state appears in the list accompanied by its flag.
* **Duplicate-guess feedback**: The input field provides instant feedback when you type a state that has already been guessed.
